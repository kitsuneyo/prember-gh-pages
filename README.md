# prember-ghpages-example

This Ember.js app is pre-rendered with Fastboot and prember and deployed to GitHub Pages

The point is to see how well Ember works as a static site generator - which, if you like Ember as I do, might be a useful thing.

## The Ember add-ons we're using

* [Ember Fastboot](https://github.com/ember-fastboot/ember-cli-fastboot) - Server-side rendering for Ember.js apps
* [prember](https://github.com/ef4/prember) - A progressive static-site generator for Ember
* [ember-cli-deploy-git](https://github.com/ef4/ember-cli-deploy-git) - An [ember-cli-deploy](https://github.com/ember-cli-deploy/ember-cli-deploy) plugin for deploying your built application to a git branch. It's particularly handy for deploying to GitHub Pages.
